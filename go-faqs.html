			  		<p class="m-bot-2">In order to view your HEP on the MedBridge GO app and complete your exercises, open the app and add your 8-digit access code given to you by your provider. An Access Code is a unique code that allows the MedBridge GO app to identify your HEP.</p>

			  		<p class="m-bot-2">Your access code can be found at the top of your printed exercise handout or in the email/SMS sent from your provider. If you never received your access code or don't remember it, please contact your provider for assistance.</p>

		  		<div class="faq">
			  		<h3 class="bold">How does MedBridge GO convert my HEP into daily dosage?</h3>
			  		<p>Dosage is defined by a therapists in the MedBridge HEP Builder. The dosage from the HEP Builder is bundled into a daily exercise program designed to improve patient adherence. When the patient opens the MedBridge GO app, this exercise program is presented on the main screen along with the total number of minutes that the program will take to complete.</p>
			  		<p class="m-bot-2">Therapists can instruct their patients to follow the program exactly, skip certain exercises, or perform a different number of reps than appears on screen - the MedBridge GO mobile app is not designed to supplant the clinician-patient relationship. Patients can mark the entire program as 'Done' or can fast-forward through individual exercises in the exercise playlist throughout playback.</p>

			  	<div class="faq">
